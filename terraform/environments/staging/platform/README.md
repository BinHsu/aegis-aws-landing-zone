# staging/platform

The EKS platform layer for `aegis-staging`. Contains the EKS cluster, Fargate profiles for system pods (CoreDNS, Karpenter controller), the IRSA OIDC provider, Access Entries mapping the CI role and operator SSO role to Kubernetes cluster-admin, **Karpenter v1** (controller on Fargate + default NodePool + EC2NodeClass), the **AWS Load Balancer Controller** (Ingress / Service-type-LoadBalancer → ALB / NLB with ACM TLS), and **ArgoCD** with an app-of-apps root Application pointing at `aegis-core/apps/staging/`.

With Phase 3c PR 3 landed, this layer contains the full platform surface area that `aegis-core` application PRs can assume: IRSA-able OIDC, Access-Entry-gated Kubernetes API, Karpenter-provisioned node capacity, ALB provisioning via `Ingress`, and a GitOps controller that auto-syncs any commit to `aegis-core`.

## Before you touch this layer

**Read `docs/runbooks/002-eks-access.md` first.** That runbook is the authoritative source for:

- Session-start public-IP check (required for every session that touches the cluster)
- Connectivity failure diagnostic order (IP → TLS reachability → SSO → kubeconfig → Access Entries)
- Procedure for updating `public_access_cidrs` when the operator's ISP reassigns the public IP

Skipping the runbook and debugging `kubectl` failures "from the cluster outwards" is the single biggest time sink in this layer. See the runbook's section 4 for the reasoning.

## Apply prerequisites

This layer reads from three other layers:

| Dependency | Provides | Failure mode if missing |
|---|---|---|
| `shared/ipam` | CIDR pool for `staging/network` | `staging/network` plan errors — platform plan never reaches here |
| `staging/network` | VPC + private subnets for Fargate | `check "network_layer_applied"` fails in `config.tf` |
| `management/bootstrap` | PlatformAdmin SSO assignment → reserved role in staging | `check "sso_platform_admin_role_exists"` fails in `access-entries.tf` |

Apply ordering is enforced operationally by the CI workflow split:

1. `terraform-apply-baseline.yml` applies `management/bootstrap`, `shared/*`, `staging/bootstrap` on every merge to main.
2. `terraform-apply-workload.yml` (workflow_dispatch, approval-gated) applies `staging/network` → `staging/platform` → `staging/workloads` in order.

## Cost profile

Apply triggers ~$0.35/hr ongoing while the cluster is running:

| Component | Approximate cost while running |
|---|---|
| EKS control plane | $0.10/hr (~$73/month always-on) |
| Fargate (CoreDNS + Karpenter controller, ~3 pods) | ~$0.12/hr |
| Karpenter-managed Spot EC2 (LB Controller + ArgoCD + workloads) | ~$0.02/hr (typically one small Spot instance) |
| ALB (per Ingress provisioned by LB Controller) | $0.025/hr + LCU, mostly pennies at lab traffic |
| SQS (Karpenter interruption queue) | $0 at lab message volume |
| EventBridge rules (4x) | $0 at lab event volume |
| CloudWatch Logs (5 log types at lab traffic) | pennies/day |
| KMS keys (2) | $2/month (fixed, $0.03/day not teardown-able) |

See ADR-013 "Consequences" for the full cost table and why teardown discipline is load-bearing.

## Teardown

End of session:

```bash
gh workflow run terraform-teardown-workload.yml -f env=staging
gh run watch   # approve in UI
```

This destroys `staging/workloads` → `staging/platform` → `staging/network` in order. The platform destroy itself takes 5–10 minutes (cluster drain + Fargate profile removal + KMS key scheduling).

**The two KMS keys in this layer have a 30-day deletion window and continue costing $2/month until the window elapses.** This is intentional — shortening the window to speed up teardown would risk unrecoverable secrets loss if teardown was triggered in error. Accept the $2/month residual as the price of recoverable KMS destruction. See ADR-004 "Consequences → Design implications" for the parallel rationale applied to IPAM's release lag.
